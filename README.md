 Maze-Solver
 
 It is basically to find the path from starting point to end point in a 2D grid.
 The UI was created using Java Swing where a 2D grid is shown on the window and using DFS technique the grid will be traversed and it will return the co-ordinates of the path.

 Some of the Snapshots are attached below referring how the window and the output looks like.
 
 The first picture is the grid where we have to find the path.
 
 The Second picture is the output showing the co-ordinates to the destination printed on thre console.
 
 The Third picture is the actual path from source to destination found using DFS and green color was used to highlight the path.
